**Observations**: For purposes of this test I put 2 class in the same file, but I prefer to 1 file per class.

```bash
python3 portfolio.py
```

This project requires python3++ to run, and has no 3rd party dependencies

  
  

### Testing:

  

Any test runner can be used to test this project. With python you'd do:

```bash

python3 tests.py

```
